# BhaskaraBot
Hey! BhaskaraBot was developed by Jo√£o Pedro dos Santos, to help brazilian students with bhaskara equations.
The bot was done using Tweepy (a library for easy access to Twitter API) and basic Python :) 
If you have any doubts about the project or wanna talk about it, just dm at twitter: @joaop_dss or instagram @joaop_ds_
